- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Raunakdeep Srivastava
I am pursuing BCA and it's my final year.
In this period of time I have done an internship as an SEO executive.
And learned C/C++, JAVA, HTML CSS, basics of javascript and graphic design.
My key skill is that I am a keen learner and can learn any new software.
